# offensive-word-detection-using-trie
A fast and efficient C++ implementation for real-time offensive word detection using a Trie data structure.

# Detection of Offensive Words Using Tries

This project implements an efficient **Trie-based approach** to detect offensive and vulgar words in text data.  
The system is designed for **fast lookup, real-time filtering**, and scalability compared to traditional ML models.
